# FHEM Trådfri Module

This is a small extension module for the FHEM Home-Control software. It enables connectivity to an IKEA Trådfri gateway.

## Important Notice
Sadly, I'm not using the Tradfri devices anymore, thus I had to stop continuing to develop on this module. I'd be happy to transfer it to a new owner.

## About this branch (cf-dev)

This branch is used to evaluate other options for CoAP clients, here Eclipse Californium. It is one step into the direction of realtime updating of the device parameters.
You can get information about the usage of this beta version on my website: <http://electronic.kappelt.net/wordpress/ikea-tradfri-module-for-fhem-beta/>
